Project Title
react-brick-breaker

Introduction or Description
This project is an assignment for the bootcamp I am currently attending. It involves remaking a game originally written in vanilla JavaScript into React.

The game is a classic brick-breaker game where players control a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The goal of this remake is not only to replicate the functionality of the original game but also to improve it by leveraging React's component-based architecture.

Technologies

- React
- JavaScript
- HTML5
- CSS3

How to Play
Objective
The goal of the game is to break all the bricks on the screen using a bouncing ball. You control a paddle at the bottom of the screen, moving it horizontally to keep the ball from falling off and to hit the bricks.

Controls
Mouse Movement: Control the paddle's horizontal movement by moving your mouse. The paddle follows the movement of your mouse horizontally.
Any Key: Press any key on the keyboard to pause or unpause the game. This can be useful for taking a break or planning your next move.
'Play Again' Button: Click the 'Play Again' button to reload the game. This resets the score and the layout of the bricks, allowing you to start fresh.

Gameplay
The game starts with the ball positioned at the center and moving in a set direction.
Use the paddle to hit the ball back towards the bricks. The ball will bounce off the paddle, walls, and ceiling.
When the ball hits a brick, that brick is destroyed, and the ball bounces back.
You earn a point for each brick you break.
The game ends if the ball falls below the paddle. You can start a new game by clicking the 'Play Again' button.
